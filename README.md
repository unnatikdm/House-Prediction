# Bangalore Real Estate Price Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price per square foot of a property based on input features. The dataset used for this project contains detailed information on various properties in Bangalore, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.

The model is trained using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression algorithm. Users can input specific property features to get a predicted price per square foot.
